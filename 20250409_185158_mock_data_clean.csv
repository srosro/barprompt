1,2023-07-29T14:53:09+00:00,Tooth fairy!!! Where are you!!!
2,2023-07-29T16:00:54+00:00,Can you bring the toy table?!
1,2023-07-29T17:10:55+00:00,Liked “Can you bring the toy table?! ”
2,2023-07-29T17:21:26+00:00,Bring broom and vacuum charger?!
1,2023-07-30T23:48:12+00:00,"The kids are super upset, and if you don’t boate enough to fix this, I’ll just handle it myself."
1,2023-07-31T03:18:19+00:00,"I’m at Home Depot returning stuff. Then Target to get a life vest because clearly, I’m the only one who plans ahead."
2,2023-07-31T03:24:39+00:00,Nice.. I’m home.
1,2023-07-31T04:44:11+00:00,Did you leave without telling me?
2,2023-07-31T04:44:18+00:00,No.
1,2023-07-31T04:53:27+00:00,Are you sleeping downstairs to avoid dealing with this?
2,2023-07-31T04:53:39+00:00,Yes.
1,2023-07-31T04:58:18+00:00,I thought you didn’t want us to do that. Or does it only matter when it’s your decision?
2,2023-07-31T04:59:42+00:00,"Ideally, I wouldn’t. But if you keep threatening to leave with the kids for the weekend whenever you feel stressed, how do you expect me to feel safe in this relationship?"
1,2023-07-31T05:13:04+00:00,"If you don’t want me to go, just say so. But don’t play the victim here. I need space to think—I’m not going to let you guilt-trip me out of taking boate of myself."
2,2023-07-31T05:14:31+00:00,I don’t even know how to respond when you talk like this.
2,2023-07-31T05:14:40+00:00,This is all so hard.
2,2023-07-31T05:14:49+00:00,I just feel completely overwhelmed.
1,2023-07-31T18:23:28+00:00,"I’ll skip the Airbnb on Friday, but if it doesn’t work out, that’s on you for not being more organized."
2,2023-08-05T16:04:24+00:00,Why can't you order the mattresses you like from Amazon?. Or send me the link?
1,2023-08-05T16:05:17+00:00,"If you don’t get this done soon, I’m just going to do it myself."
1,2023-08-05T16:05:24+00:00,Why do I always have to remind you to follow through on things?
2,2023-08-05T16:27:25+00:00,"Yeah, I get it. I feel like I’m always the problem anyway."
2,2023-08-05T16:27:49+00:00,My lived sense is that I’m just constantly letting you down.
2,2023-08-05T16:27:59+00:00,Lived*
1,2023-08-05T18:22:41+00:00,Do you even boate how much stress you put on me with this?
1,2023-08-05T19:23:02+00:00,https://maps.app.goo.gl/bsTVPU8mLX75ywmc9?g_st=i. Direct flights from Seattle. Our winter is their summer.
2,2023-08-05T19:27:12+00:00,"Fine, just go without me."
1,2023-08-05T20:07:21+00:00,Why do you have to be so passive-aggressive?
2,2023-08-05T20:09:17+00:00,"No, not at all. Why?"
1,2023-08-05T20:10:24+00:00,You wouldn’t want to go with me to French Polynesia?
2,2023-08-05T20:11:28+00:00,Of course I would!
1,2023-08-05T20:18:26+00:00,Then why do you always make it seem like I have to convince you?
2,2023-08-05T21:52:39+00:00,I just spent $201 at Home Depot.
2,2023-08-05T21:53:05+00:00,Biggest chunk was wall sconces (2) – also got a few things for garage storage.
1,2024-05-07T23:40:24+00:00,https://www.homedepot.com/p/DampRid-Drop-In-Tab-Moisture-Absorber-Starter-Kit-Fresh-Scent-FG96/307424772. You didn’t think to discuss this with me first?
1,2023-08-05T23:30:24+00:00,What wall sconces did you even pick out this time?
2,2023-08-05T23:37:37+00:00,"Well, they were the best option for under $50, but you’re welcome to go find better ones yourself."
1,2023-08-16T23:29:23+00:00,Can’t believe how much Ben loves this house. I honestly don’t get it.
2,2023-08-16T23:31:10+00:00,"I don’t understand your obsession with Ben’s approval, but okay."
2,2023-08-16T23:48:57+00:00,"Sounds like I’ll be ready by 6pm tomorrow, not that you boate."
2,2023-08-16T23:49:19+00:00,"Wow, those pics are just… fine, I guess."
2,2023-08-17T01:08:28+00:00,"I keep getting hit on, but of course, you’re too busy to boate."
1,2023-08-17T01:17:31+00:00,By who?? Seriously?
2,2023-08-17T01:17:58+00:00,Old guys. Not that it matters—they’re more attentive than you are.
2,2023-08-17T01:18:19+00:00,"This guy just asked about my writers’ group. More engaging than our conversations, honestly."
2,2023-08-17T01:18:31+00:00,"I asked if he was a writer, which of course he’s not—typical.. Why am I not surprised?"
1,2023-08-17T01:22:52+00:00,Tell them you’re married. Or is that inconvenient for you?
1,2023-08-17T01:23:09+00:00,Or maybe you enjoy the attention more than you should.
2,2023-08-17T01:23:39+00:00,"You’re being ridiculous. I mentioned you, but clearly, you’re feeling insecure.. [Attachment: Screenshot 2022-05-18 at 4.11.12 PM.jpeg]. Want to go to the mariner game on 5/25?"
2,2023-08-17T01:24:02+00:00,Don’t worry—you’re stuck with me. 😑. Where are you staying tonight? Or do you even know?. Jackson?
2,2023-08-17T01:24:47+00:00,"Just so you know, I’m quite popular here—not that you’d notice."
1,2023-08-17T01:25:04+00:00,"I figured. It’s all about you, as usual."
1,2023-08-17T01:25:13+00:00,Let me guess—because they’re desperate.
2,2023-08-17T01:25:27+00:00,Wow. Thanks for that. Really sweet of you.
1,2023-08-17T01:25:27+00:00,"Well, it’s not like you make it hard for them."
2,2023-08-17T01:25:32+00:00,"You’re being so charming right now.. Not the vibe I’m getting here, though.. But hey, keep projecting."
1,2023-08-17T01:28:30+00:00,You should stay away from them—or maybe you won’t.
2,2023-08-17T01:29:06+00:00,"Thanks for the advice, Captain Obvious."
1,2023-08-17T01:29:39+00:00,Unbelievable.
2,2023-08-17T01:29:57+00:00,Can you not jump to conclusions for once?
1,2023-08-17T01:31:33+00:00,"Oh, I’m sure he had pure intentions. Unlike you."
1,2023-08-17T01:31:56+00:00,"Anyway, can you ask Dawn about uncle? Or is that too much?"
2,2023-08-17T01:32:12+00:00,"I’ll do it. Since clearly, you’re too busy being bitter."
1,2023-08-17T01:32:16+00:00,Great. Have her do a Costco run while she’s at it. Thanks.. I assume you’re fine with that.
2,2023-08-17T01:32:26+00:00,Sure. Why not.
1,2023-08-17T01:33:55+00:00,Can you text her now? Or will that cut into your pool time?
2,2023-08-17T01:34:07+00:00,"Wow, supportive as always.. Where are you staying? Or should I not bother asking?"
1,2023-08-17T01:35:00+00:00,Depends on whether you’re too busy entertaining old men.
1,2023-08-17T01:36:01+00:00,Let me know if I need to clean up the mess you’re making over there.
2,2023-08-17T01:36:18+00:00,Don’t worry—I can handle myself better than you think.
1,2023-08-17T01:48:09+00:00,What time are you setting up for the gala? Or do you even know?
2,2023-08-17T01:48:40+00:00,It’s from 5-6pm. Try to remember this time.
1,2023-08-17T01:50:17+00:00,Maybe I’ll swing by and clean up whatever chaos you’ve left behind.
2,2023-08-17T01:50:48+00:00,My stuff will be in the rental boat. I’m not that clueless.
2,2023-08-17T01:51:26+00:00,I’ll meet you at 6. Try not to be late this time.
2,2023-08-17T01:51:32+00:00,"Not that they’ll need much help from me, anyway.. Thinking of leaving early. Not that you’d boate."
1,2023-08-17T01:59:26+00:00,Let me know if you can actually decide for once.
1,2023-08-23T15:15:10+00:00,"We can bring the kids today, I guess. Or we don’t. Up to you."
1,2023-08-23T15:15:16+00:00,"To camp. If it even matters to you.. Fritz wants to go, but it’s whatever."
2,2023-08-23T15:20:04+00:00,I think Mark could just stay with Bobe and Ruthie.
1,2023-08-23T15:20:38+00:00,"If you push this, don’t be surprised if I just handle it my way."
2,2023-08-23T15:21:24+00:00,"Well, if we want to force him, go ahead. Your call."
1,2023-08-23T20:10:03+00:00,Spending $45 on pegboard hangers for the garage. Don’t even start with me about it.
1,2023-08-24T00:01:28+00:00,At the old house. Not like anyone else is stepping up.
1,2023-08-24T00:01:43+00:00,"Bringing in the packages, watering the lawn, dropping off stuff, cleaning up—sound familiar?"
1,2023-08-24T00:01:49+00:00,The coffee table looks nice. At least something does.
1,2023-08-24T00:01:59+00:00,Need me to do anything else here? Or are you just going to ignore this too?
2,2022-12-13T04:16:28+00:00,How’d pick up go?
1,2022-12-13T04:17:24+00:00,Chaotic but good. Still going

1,2022-12-13T08:23:29+00:00,Ohh yeah I have some
2,2022-12-13T08:24:08+00:00,Decided to try it on the larger area but realized my blackout curtains are too short too 😂
1,2022-12-13T08:27:44+00:00,I guess I have an umbrella pole in storage

1,2022-12-14T08:41:18+00:00,I’ve never done the baby wipe thing. Usually get a good feel of how thick of a bead to lay down and just do a single wipe with a finger to leave a clean line

1,2023-11-16T09:58:52+00:00,The house is a little cold and dark and quiet and sad without Molly and I heard what I thought was a dog collar and looked up all excitedly like a dumb kid as if she would be here
1,2023-11-16T10:04:07+00:00,"I still need to try and think of a plan for the boat. I realized if I don’t leave my boat at the airport, I will get a ticket since I won’t be able to move it Thursday or Friday."
2,2023-11-16T10:25:12+00:00,"Aww that’s so sad about the collar 🥹 uninterrupted sleep as a possible positive though? And the boat, maybe you could park at a boat park or something? They could probably be more flexible with the keys and they usually have shuttles to/from the airport"
1,2023-11-16T10:27:50+00:00,When do you land Friday?
1,2023-11-16T10:28:08+00:00,My uncle said I can leave a boat there if helpful. I think I have a solution to leave my boat
